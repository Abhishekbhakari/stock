I liked the detailed approach of incorporating fundamental analysis with the EVM model, focus on looking profits sensibly. One of the discussion helped to address all queries I had. I am very happy with the emerging market income. Happy to continue taking Equity Value recommendations.",

      "I don't have the skill set and capability to look for investments on my own. I have always used to invest in high cost assets in the past for investment returns. That's where Equity Value come, the process is seamless and you get adequate control on the amount and you don't have to pay fees. It was a refreshing personal touch of Adroit to what I was about this engagement.",

I would suggest them to anyone looking for a professional and results-driven investment approach.",
