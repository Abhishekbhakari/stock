                Money Laundering involves disguising financial assets so that they can be used without detection of the illegal activity that produced them. Through money laundering, the launderer transforms the monetary proceeds derived from criminal activity into funds with an apparent legal source. Money laundering is the process by which criminals attempt to hide and disguise the true origin and ownership of the proceeds of their criminal activities.
                <br /><br />
                The term "Money Laundering" is also used in relation to the financing of terrorist activity (where the funds may, or may not, originate from crime). Money Laundering is a process of making dirty money look clean.
                <br /><br />
                Money is moved around the financial system again and again in such manner that its origin gets hidden.
